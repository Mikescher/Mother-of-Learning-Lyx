\begin_layout Standard
Despite how much the experience had annoyed Zach, Zorian judged their meeting
 with Xvim to have been a full success.
 Sure, Xvim had been openly dismissive of Zach's skills, but that was just Xvim
 being Xvim.
 The man had been impressed in his own way, else he would not have kept pushing
 Zach towards ever more demanding shaping exercises as their meeting
 progressed.
 Not that this outcome was surprising – there was a lot to be impressed about
 when it came to Zach's shaping, especially if one knew how big his mana
 reserves were.
 His fellow time traveler had not honed his shaping skills to the same
 ridiculous standard that Zorian had achieved under Xvim's tutelage, but he was
 clearly far better than he had any right to be.
 Zorian was confident that the skills Zach displayed in that office would be
 taken as a point in their favor.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The next day, Zorian decided to introduce Zach to Alanic as well and see if the
 priest was open to the idea of teaching Zach some of his soul defenses.
 Accordingly, they went to the priest first thing in the morning, effectively
 skipping an entire day of classes.
 Not that skipping classes was much of a problem for either of them at this
 point.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The start of the meeting went about as Zorian expected it would.
 Zach talked, Alanic listened, and Zorian mostly stayed quiet.
 The priest already knew the nature of their request, since Zorian had already
 explained things to him while arranging the meeting, but he wanted to hear
 Zach's version of the story as well before he agreed to anything.
 Thankfully, Zach successfully kept to the script and didn't blurt out anything
 he wasn't supposed to.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Their story was, in essence, very simple: the two of them had ended up on the
 receiving end of a soul magic attack and now had some kind of marker stamped
 on their soul.
 Zach, being shaken by the experience, now wanted to learn how to defend
 himself from similar attacks.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"There is one thing that is bothering me about this," Alanic told them when
 Zach finished his tale, shifting his attention from Zach to Zorian.
 "If both of you suffered from this attack, how come only Zach is interested in
 learning how to defend his soul? Does the experience you went through not
 worry you as well?"

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Ah, well, I already know how to perceive and defend my soul," Zorian admitted.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Really?" Alanic said curiously, raising his eyebrows in a silent question.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Why would I lie?" asked Zorian with a shrug.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Alanic stared at him for a second before reaching across the table they were
 gathered around and grasping his shoulder tightly in his hand.
 Zorian was about to ask him what the hell he thought he was doing when
 suddenly all of his senses went haywire.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He swayed in his chair for a moment, the world around him spinning and melting
 like a bad illusion and his body feeling like it was being twisted into some
 unnatural form.
 Then he realized what was happening and used his magic to violently shove
 Alanic's attack away from his soul.
 It worked, and the world immediately returned to normal, but Zorian had an
 uncomfortable feeling that had more to do with Alanic backing off at the first
 sign of resistance than him being all that good.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He gave the man a nasty glare, and Alanic removed his hand from Zorian's
 shoulder.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Shoddy defenses," Alanic said.
 "Serviceable, but shoddy.
 You should reconsider you decision, mister Kazinski.
 You could use my instruction as much as mister Noveda here."

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"I know that!" Zorian snapped.
 "I just thought…"

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
…that Alanic would refuse to teach him, since he didn't want to do so in
 previous restarts.
 Well, not without receiving explanations that Zorian had been unwilling to
 give the man at that time.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hmm.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"You know what? Nevermind that," Zorian sighed.
 "Does that mean you're willing to teach us, then? Both of us?"

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"I suppose I am," Alanic said, tapping his fingers against the table for a few
 seconds.
 "You are hiding things from me, but I don't think it's something sinister.
 Who taught you how to feel your soul, if I may ask?"

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"A friendly shifter," said Zorian.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Partially true, even if Alanic had done the lion's share of the work.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"A shifter, huh?" Alanic said, giving him another long look.
 "Very well.
 Come with me so I can check up on this marker you two received from your
 attacker."

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Err, we don't want it removed," Zach hurriedly said.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Yes, you already said that," Alanic said.
 "I just want to have a look.
 Don't worry, I'm not doing anything to you without your consent."

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"You mean like launching a surprise soul attack to test our claims of already
 having a soul defense?" asked Zorian snidely.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Don't be so whiny," Alanic told him unsympathetically.
 "That was just a light tap, spiritually speaking."

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"That 'light tap' almost caused me to vomit all over your table," Zorian told
 him.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Hmph," Alanic scoffed.
 "Your defenses are even shoddier than I thought, then."

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sighing, Zorian decided to drop the issue.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"What is it with you and annoying teachers?" Zach whispered to him as they
 followed Alanic deeper into the temple that served as his house.
 "Is this going to be a recurring thing with you? I don't think I can handle a
 repeat of the Xvim episode this soon."

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Zorian was tempted to bring Zach to Silverlake after this, just to show him the
 

\emph on

true

\emph default

 meaning of annoying.
 At least Alanic and Xvim were each helpful in their own way in addition to
 being hard to deal with.
 He wondered if Zach was good enough to deal with the grey hunter… he probably
 could kill the beast, but could he do it in a way that keeps the eggs intact?

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Though now that he thought about it, Silverlake probably doesn't count as a
 teacher.
 She had taught him precisely nothing so far.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Mr Zosk is way less annoying than Xvim," he whispered back to Zach, putting
 his musings aside for the moment.
 "He can be pretty harsh at times, but he's always fair.
 He doesn't insult people without good reason.
 The truth is my soul defenses really 

\emph on

are

\emph default

 shoddy at the moment.
 Give him a chance."

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"I'm happy you have so much faith in me, mister Kazinski," Alanic said, butting
 into their conversation.
 Oops, guess they weren't quiet enough.
 Or maybe Alanic's hearing was just that good.
 "This Xvim fellow you keep talking about sounds fascinating.
 I hope you can introduce us sometime."

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Zorian made a sour face.
 Bringing Xvim and Alanic together into the same room? Yeah, no way in hell was
 he letting that happen…

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Alanic seemed to have noticed Zorian's distaste for the idea because he
 actually laughed at him.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"I was just joking, mister Kazinski," the priest said, his voice still tinged
 with amusement.
 "If I really wanted to meet this 'Xvim', I would have sought him out on my
 own.
 With a name like that, I doubt he'd be hard to find."

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"I suppose you're right," Zorian admitted.
 'Xvim' was a fairly exotic name, and he had a feeling that his mentor was
 rather famous within certain circles as well.
 Everyone who worked in a prestigious institution like Cyoria's Royal Magical
 Academy was at least somewhat famous.
 All in all, Xvim probably wasn't very hard to find for someone like Alanic,
 who clearly had connections to one or more spy organizations.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Not for the first time, Zorian found himself wondering what exactly would
 happen if he told Alanic about the time loop.
 Not in this restart, obviously, but as an idea for the future… well, he could
 use the battle-priest's help and advice.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then again, he wasn't working alone any more, was he? He would have to see what
 Zach would say about that.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Oh well.
 Hopefully Alanic would leave a better impression on Zach than Xvim had.

\begin_layout Standard
"Ugh," Zach said as they departed from Alanic's home.
 "That psychedelic potion is pure hell.
 And I'm apparently going to have to go through several restarts worth of that
 stuff?"

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"You didn't have to take it," Zorian pointed out.
 "Its only purpose is to speed things up.
 You could have taken the slow, painless way and meditated your way to soul
 perception."

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"No, I know my limits," Zach said, shaking his head.
 "Even you opted for the 'fast' route, and I'm even more impatient than you
 are.
 How you managed to pretend to be unaware of the time loop all this time I'll
 never fathom… What did he have you do while I was off hallucinating, anyway?"

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"That 'light touch' stuff he tried on me earlier," grimaced Zorian.
 "He kept using weak soul attacks on me while having me fight him off.
 It's helpful, I guess.
 At the very least it gives me some experience in fending off soul
 manipulation.
 I usually rely on actual defensive wards to counter hostile soul magic, but
 this sort of stuff is useful if I'm ever caught off-guard with some casual
 soul spell.
 It's strange, though.
 Why is Alanic willing to help me refine my soul defenses now that I've brought
 you along? Why does your presence make him 

\emph on

less

\emph default

 suspicious of me?"

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"I guess I just look like a more honest person than you do," Zach said with a
 grin.
 Zorian rolled his eyes at him.
 "Anyway, what now?"

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Now? Well, you either go home and do whatever you want, or you go with me to
 Knyazov Dveri while I visit the local dungeon," Zorian told him.
 "I was going to go there while you had your lessons with Alanic, but that idea
 obviously had to be scrapped, so I guess I'll do it now."

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"You were going to go have fun in the dungeon while I suffered back there?"
 Zach frowned.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Depends how you define fun," Zorian said.
 "I'm just going to load up on crystalized mana before getting back to the
 surface."

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"I'm not sure I understand," Zach said.
 "Why would you need so much crystalized mana?"

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Money, of course," Zorian said.
 "I use some of it for my magic items and golems, but most of it is sold for
 some quick cash.
 I memorized where the crystal clumps are over the restarts, so it doesn't take
 long to pick up a lot of them.
 It's almost like collecting money."

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Zach was quiet for a while.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Well crap," said Zach after a while.
 "That's clever.
 Why didn't I think of that? I could have used that trick a decade or so ago…"

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"What, you had cash problems?" Zorian asked curiously.
 "Aren't you obscenely rich?"

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"I don't have nearly as much money as people think," Zach shook his head.
 Oh, right, his guardian kind of robbed him.
 "Hell, I don't have nearly as much money as 

\emph on

I

\emph default

 thought I did, thanks to my slimy caretaker.
 But the real problem is that most of my money is unavailable to me.
 It's all either banked into long-term accounts or stored away in ways that
 make it really hard for me to get to it on short notice.
 And even if I could get to it easily, I would still have to justify my
 expenses to my caretaker and get his permission in order to spend any
 significant sum.
 Which means that when I really wanted to spend a lot of money during the
 restarts, I basically had to get the money from scratch somehow…"

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Hmm.
 And how did you solve that?"

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Well, these days I just kill some rare magical creature and sell the corpse,"
 Zach shrugged.
 "You can earn huge amounts of cash if you know who to sell it to.
 I really like your solution, though.
 It's a lot safer, and not even that much more time consuming.
 Doesn't dumping a huge amount of crystalized mana on the market collapse the
 price, though?"

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Zorian shook his head.
 "In the grand scheme of things, the amounts of crystalized mana I can gather
 in a few days are a drop in the bucket.
 Even if I focused on doing nothing else for the entire restart, I'd only
 produce a fraction of what dedicated mines produce on a daily basis.
 Though trying to sell too much to individual shops does tend to bring unwanted
 attention."

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Alright," Zach nodded.
 "So how are we doing this?"

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align center
\begin_inset Graphics

\end_inset

\begin_layout Standard
Later that day, when they finally returned to Cyoria, Zorian was lugging no
 less than five luggage boxes full of crystalized mana – a lot more than his
 excursions into the dungeons beneath Knyazov Dveri usually got him.
 They probably went a little overboard with their crystal collection, but that
 was fine.
 One could never have too much money.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Zorian usually stuck to the safer areas of the dungeon he had mapped and
 explored a long time ago when embarking on his crystal gathering expeditions,
 but Zach had insisted they explore the dungeon a little deeper than usual this
 time.
 Since the other time traveler was so powerful, Zorian had agreed.
 He was actually somewhat curious if they could find something interesting.
 In the end, though, they didn't discover anything too amazing – just several
 new crystal clumps and some strange cave plants that Zorian couldn't identify
 and decided to bring along with him.
 He could then show them to Kael when the boy finally showed up again.
 They didn't stumble upon anything particularly dangerous, which pleased Zorian
 (who didn't want to end the restart short because they died to some stupid
 monster in the dungeon depths) and disappointed Zach (who had been hoping for
 a good fight to blow off some steam).

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Just as they were about to separate and go each to their own homes, Zach
 suddenly spoke up.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"That was kind of fun," he said.
 "We should go deeper next time."

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"That's a bad idea," Zorian said.
 "We already went past the depth where I met this floating mass of eyes that
 killed me just by looking at me.
 It's only luck we didn't meet anything like that today.
 Do you really want to cut one of our restarts short by dying to some stupid
 monster?"

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Ugh.
 You're no fun," Zach complained.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"We can always go hunting all the monsters that are terrorizing the city now
 that aranea are gone," Zorian pointed out.
 "I already did that with Taiven in previous restarts, but… well, I can never
 really set myself loose when I'm around her.
 She knows me too well to accept my growth in skill at face value."

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Taiven.
 I remember her," Zach said.
 "She was your date for the evening that time when I invited all the students
 to my home for the summer festival.
 Are you close to her?"

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Not in the way you're probably thinking of.
 We're just friends," Zorian said.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Friends that go on dates together?" Zach said with a grin.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ugh.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"I'm pretty sure I told you something like this back then, but Taiven isn't
 interested in guys like me.
 I'm not her type," Zorian responded, hoping this was the end of it.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Yeah, fat chance of that.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Ah, so she shot you down then," Zach nodded sagely.
 "Well, don't let it get to you.
 You can't get to them all, even with the time loop and its multiple retries.
 I never managed to talk either Raynie or Akoja to go out on a date with me,
 for example, no matter what I tried…"

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Zorian was sorely tempted to ask Zach about his attempts to woo Akoja, since
 that was bound to have been amusing, in a train-wreck sort of way.
 In the end, however, he decided that he really didn't want to know.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"I hope you realize that I've been in this time loop for only a handful of
 years and that most of that time has been spent while under threat and under
 pressure from various 'emergencies'," Zorian told him.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Yes, so?" Zach asked, not understanding his point.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Aside from picking a girl for the date at the end of the restart, I never went
 out on any dates," Zorian told him.
 Did his meetings with Raynie count as dates? No, probably not.
 "I certainly didn't go after every single girl in the class like you seem to
 have done."

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Zach stared at him in silence for a few seconds, apparently struck speechless
 at Zorian's statement.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Seriously?!" he eventually asked, his voice incredulous.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Seriously," Zorian confirmed.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"You're crazy," Zach told him.
 "Mark my words, you'll regret this once we're out of this time loop.
 You'll never get a chance like this in your life!"

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"You sound like an old man," Zorian said.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Well, I 

\emph on

am

\emph default

 several decades older than you," Zach pointed out.
 "Listen to your elders, young man, I know what I'm talking about…"

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ten minutes and a lot of pointless banter later, they finally called it a day
 and separated.
 Strangely enough, despite the fact he spent the entire day either having his
 soul slapped around, crawling through dark, monster-infested tunnels or being
 teased by his fellow time traveler, Zorian found himself happy with how it
 turned out.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Though he really could have gone without that last conversation – now he
 couldn't stop thinking about the various girls in his life.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And he was certain that if Zach knew about it, he would be laughing at his
 predicament.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The jerk.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align center

\end_inset

\begin_layout Standard
Two days after their meeting with Xvim, the man called Zorian in his office to
 tell him that he had tentatively accepted his story as plausible and to talk
 about what they should do next.
 That was… surprisingly fast.
 It was interesting to experience just how big of an effect Zach's presence had
 on people he talked to.
 Both Xvim and Alanic seemed to be taking him more seriously this time around,
 just because there was a second person backing his story up.
 Was it just that multiple people were convincing in a way that a single person
 wasn't, or was there more to it?

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He was tempted to ask Xvim about the topic directly, but it was unlikely he
 could offer much insight into the thought processes of his previous
 incarnations and would force him to admit he was purposely restricting Xvim's
 access to relevant information about the time loop.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Regardless, he currently found himself standing in front of Xvim on one of the
 Academy's many training grounds, waiting for the lessons to start.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"So," Xvim said.
 "I see you are here alone.
 I take it your fellow time traveler declined my offer, then?"

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"I'm afraid you didn't leave the best impression on him the last time you met,
 sir," Zorian told him respectfully.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"A pity.
 He could have used my help.
 But enough about the easily discouraged – we're here to help you.
 You say you've already worked with me to hone your dimensionalism? Show me,
 then."

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Zorian didn't have to ask what Xvim was talking about.
 He took out a large, oval rock from his jacket pocket and outstretched his
 hand in front of him so Xvim could see the stone.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And then he generated a flawless dimensional boundary around the stone.
 Visually, nothing happened… but Zorian knew Xvim could tell the difference
 somehow.
 He supposed that his ability to sense magic was just that good.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Passable," Xvim said, passing his judgement.
 "Keep working on it in your free time, but I suppose I can work with this."

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Zorian nodded, and quietly pocketed the stone, his long experience with Xvim
 allowing him to shrug off his mentor's ridiculous perfectionism without really
 getting upset.
 His dimensional boundary was more than just 'passable' and they both knew it.
 Zorian had already started to work on forming a dimensional boundary over
 complex objects like small statues and planned to move on to live, moving
 insects soon.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"You seem to have rather good grasp on the basic teleport spell, and even know
 a great many variants," Xvim said.
 "So today I will show you how to defend against teleportation instead."

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"I already know how to ward places against teleportation," pointed out Zorian.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Truly?" Xvim said.
 "Let's test that."

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He waved his hands, conjuring four glowing orbs of light that quickly assumed a
 square formation over a large section of the training ground.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Ward that area against teleportation, and then I'll do my best to teleport
 in," Xvim told him.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Shrugging, Zorian went and did just that.
 He was quite good at warding, in his humble opinion, but he had no illusions
 that his wards would actually hold against Xvim's attempts to sidestep it.
 Who knows what kind of sophisticated teleportation spells his mentor had at
 his disposal?

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There.
 Not his best work, perhaps, as he was slightly rushed for time and didn't have
 any fancy materials to work with, but that should at least force him to spend
 some time to-

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Without saying a word, Xvim unceremoniously dispelled his teleportation ward
 with a wide-area dispel and teleported into the previously warded area.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Though he knew it wouldn't help, Zorian just couldn't help himself.
 He just had to say it.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"That's cheating," he said.
 "You told me you were going to try teleport in, not that you'd just dispel the
 ward."

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"And an actual attacker would play by the rules, hmm?" Xvim asked him.
 "You don't think they would just teleport to the edge of the ward and get rid
 of it?"

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"If you gave me time to prepare, the ward would be anchored to something and be
 nigh impossible to dispel like that," Zorian said.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"And if you gave me time to prepare I'd bring a couple of mana siphons to
 starve the ward into collapse," Xvim said pitilessly.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Ugh.
 Fine.
 Can I have another try?" Zorian asked.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Of course," Xvim nodded.
 "You can have as many tries as you want."

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Two hours later and 5 ward refinements later, Zorian had a warding scheme that
 Xvim couldn't just casually dispel whenever he wished.
 He had to extend the ward far outside the limits of the area indicated by
 Xvim's glowing orbs, but apparently that wasn't cheating either.
 The man even praised him for 'finally thinking outside the box'.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And then, when he finally couldn't dispel the ward, Xvim promptly teleported
 into the area as if the ward had never existed.
 Zorian wouldn't have been so upset about that, except that Xvim didn't appear
 to have used anything more complex than a basic teleport to do so.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"What happened?" he asked the man.
 "How did you teleport in with just the regular teleport? There are three
 stages of the basic teleport, and I made sure to suppress each and every one
 of them."

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"I made a microscopic dimensional gate and used it to extend a ward-suppressing
 bubble in the middle of the area," Xvim said.
 "Then I simply teleported into a patch of effectively unprotected land.
 It is a standard way of getting into heavily-warded areas, though most people
 use magic items thrown into the area instead of creating a microscopic gate
 like I did."

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"I presume this is because they can't create a gate like that, even a tiny
 one," Zorian said.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Yes," Xvim confirmed.
 "But I'm hardly unique in this capacity, so it would be best to know how to
 deal with the tactic."

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Fine," Zorian said wearily.
 "I admit defeat, master.
 I don't know how to ward against teleportation effectively, so please teach me
 how.
 And if possible, I'd also like to know how to make the micro-gate thing, too."

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"I suspect that level of skill is still beyond you, my student," Xvim told him
 with a small smile.
 "But we'll see.
 Now listen closely…"

\begin_layout Standard
Days passed.
 Aside from getting lessons from both Alanic and Xvim, Zorian spent his time
 playing games with Kirielle and creating experimental spell formula
 blueprints.
 He sought out Nora Boole's help for the latter task, discussing his designs
 with the enthusiastic woman that helped him start on his current path so long
 ago.
 She was surprisingly helpful, even after all this time… though it did bring
 him a bit more attention that he would have liked, since Nora couldn't shut up
 about this amazing spell formula talent she had found among the students.
 With Red Robe out of the picture, however, he didn't care as much about
 attracting attention.
  

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He and Zach also went to hunt monsters that kept spilling into Cyoria a couple
 of times.
 Zorian already knew where a lot of them made their nests and which paths they
 took to the surface, and since he didn't have to feign ignorance around Zach,
 they thinned out monster populations considerably during those couple of
 visits to Cyoria's underground.
 At Zorian's request, Zach mostly let Zorian tackle the monsters on his own,
 only getting himself involved when he had to.
 Which was embarrassingly often, to Zorian's annoyance – his combat skills were
 steadily growing, but he still wasn't a one man army like Zach was.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Eventually Kael arrived at Imaya's place, and Zorian brought both him and
 Taiven into the time loop.
 Kael was very easy to convince, like usual, but Taiven was still rather
 incredulous about the idea.
 Then again, she always was rather hard to convince that he was telling the
 truth…

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Currently he and Zach were just lazing around in an empty meadow, far from any
 settlement.
 Well, any 

\emph on

inhabited

\emph default

 settlement.
 There was a small village nearby, but it had been completely depopulated
 during the Weeping, and now the locals considered the entire area cursed and
 refused to move back in.
 Zorian didn't expect that to last for long, but for now the village remained
 empty and the fields overgrown with grass.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Though the background of the place was rather morbid, it was a very beautiful
 location otherwise.
 Zach had really found some nice sites in his decades of wandering the
 continent.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"So what was Kael being so excited about the other day?" Zach asked him.
 "I don't remember him being so excited about the time loop in the previous
 restart."

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Well, since I no longer have to worry about keeping my head down to stay below
 Red Robe's radar, Kael decided he can conscript some of the local alchemists
 for that research he keeps transferring across restarts," Zorian said.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"That sounds very expensive," Zach said, frowning.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"It probably will be," Zorian said, nodding.
 "I'd be annoyed at him throwing my money around like that, but in truth I
 really don't have much use for most of it.
 Besides, I can always dip into other sources of cash if I ever run out."

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Other sources?" Zach asked.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"I know the locations of several secret stashes of the Ibasans and the cultists
 scattered around Cyoria," Zorian said.
 "And I can always rob their houses too, since I know where a lot of them live
 and all."

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"But that's stealing," Zach protested.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Yes?" Zorian confirmed, mystified at Zach's response.
 "Why wouldn't I steal from them? They're a bunch of murderous invaders."

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Well… I guess it makes sense," Zach admitted.
 "But it just feels wrong to me, you know?"

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"But you didn't feel uncomfortable helping me violently break into aranean
 settlements so we could violate their minds for practice and skill theft?"
 Zorian asked curiously.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Zach winced.
 "I, uh… didn't think of it that way.
 Besides, they're giant spiders.
 It's easier to justify that sort of thing when I can't read their body cues
 and they don't bother to talk to me about it."

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"That's because you had a mind blank on," Zorian noted.
 "They literally 

\emph on

couldn't

\emph default

 talk to you.
 They did talk to me, though.
 They asked, even begged us to stop plenty of times."

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Uh, wow," said Zach awkwardly.
 "That's… pretty messed up.
 I always did wonder why you were so reluctant to do attack more than one
 colony each day…"

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Zorian nodded silently.
 He wasn't exactly dying of guilt over what they did, but that was one restart
 he never intended to reenact in the future.
 There was no way he could keep doing that without becoming a monster.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After a short silence, Zach spoke up again.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"You know, Zorian," he said.
 "After watching you fight against the aranea in that restart and against other
 monsters in this one, I couldn't help but notice your combat magic is a
 little… basic."

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"I guess," Zorian said slowly, wondering what the other boy was getting at.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"It's not bad!" Zach hastened to add.
 "It's pretty good, all things considered.
 But, well… I don't think it's good enough for what we need to do."

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Fair enough," Zorian agreed.
 "I am working on it, though.
 I suppose you think I'm not doing enough?"

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Actually, I was going to offer to teach you some more spells," Zach grinned.
 "I'm not much of a teacher, but I don't have to be one in order to increase
 your arsenal of combat spells."

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There was no reason to say no – Zorian was always happy to learn more spells,
 especially restricted ones like most combat spells.
 Of course, learning spells was not the same as being able to use them
 effectively in combat, which was why Zorian still relied primarily on classics
 like magic missile, shield, fireball and the like.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It quickly became obvious that many of Zach's favorite tricks wouldn't work
 well for Zorian.
 For instance, Zach loved the shield variations that created multiple layers of
 force instead of a single shielding plane – while extremely effective, they
 had extreme mana costs associated with them as well.
 He also loved using spells in large swarms to overwhelm enemy defenses, which
 was likewise an impractical tactic for Zorian.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Still…

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Okay then, this is one of those fancy hexagon shields you sometimes see in
 illustrations," said Zach, casting the spell deliberately slowly so Zorian
 could memorize the movements and chants.
 A ghostly sphere made of interlocking hexagons sprung out around Zach.
 "I personally find it too much of a chore, but it sounds like it can work well
 for someone like you.
 The main advantage is that if an attack punches through, it will only destroy
 one hexagon instead of collapsing the entire shield.
 Though this does make the shield as a whole somewhat weaker than a layered
 aegis I showed you earlier.
 Hence me not using it much."

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"That does sound more suited to me," Zorian admitted.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"We should probably stop for today," Zach said, dismissing the shield.
 It promptly dissolved into glittering motes of lights instead of simply
 winking out of existence like a regular shield did.
 Pretty.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Yes," Zorian agreed.
 "It's best I spend some time experimenting with stuff you've already shown me
 before I bother learning more new stuff."

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Don't be afraid to ask for help," Zach said.
 "Hell, maybe one day you'll even teach 

\emph on

me

\emph default

 something."

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Zorian cocked his eyebrow at him.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Who says I can't teach you something now?" he asked the boy.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Eh, I meant something related to combat magic," Zach clarified, waving his
 hand through the air dismissively.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"So did I," Zorian immediately countered.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Zorian, please," Zach snorted derisively.
 "Combat magic is my thing.
 I've been working on it for decades now.
 Even if you know some obscure spell I've never encountered, I probably already
 have something better in my arsenal.
 Any feat of combat magic you can do, I can either duplicate or exceed."

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Hmm," Zorian hummed thoughtfully.
 "That calls for a little test, I think.
 Do you think you're up to it?"

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Sure," Zach shrugged.
 "What do you have in mind?"

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"See that rock over there?" Zorian said, pointing at a large stone some
 distance away from them.
 Zach motioned for Zorian to continue.
 "Keep an eye on it while I cast my spell."

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Alright," Zach said, retreating to a healthy distance and positioning himself
 so he could easily see both Zorian and the stone at the same time.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Slowly and carefully, Zorian went through the motions of the spell.
 Zach looked torn between confusion and amusement, since the spell was clearly
 just a magic missile, but said nothing and opted to just watch instead.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Zorian finished the spell.
 For a second, nothing seemed to happen.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then the rock Zorian designated as his target exploded into a shower of stone
 fragments, causing Zach to flinch in surprise at the sudden, unexpected
 detonation.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"What?" he asked uncomprehendingly.
 He gave Zorian a suspicious glance.
 "Did you put an explosive glyph on that stone beforehand or something?"

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Nope," Zorian said, grinning widely.
 "I cast an invisible magic missile at it."

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Invisible magic missile?" Zach asked slowly.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Didn't you know?" Zorian asked innocently.
 "A flawlessly cast force spell is perfectly transparent, making it effectively
 invisible.
 It took me quite a while to achieve this, but I'm sure a master combat mage
 like yourself has mastered this years ago."

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Zach stared at him for a second before shifting his gaze to the shattered rock
 the magic missile had demolished.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"So," Zorian began, smiling brightly.
 "How long do you think it will take you to duplicate that?"

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\end_inset

\begin_layout Standard
Three days later, Zorian was kind of regretting one-upping Zach like he did.
 Ever since then, his fellow time traveler seemed obsessed with duplicating
 Zorian's feat, refusing to understand that this wasn't something you could
 achieve by working on it really hard for a couple of days.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"I'm not even sure why you're so upset about this," Zorian finally told him.
 "It's just a neat trick that people like you have no need for anyway."

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"It's the principle of the thing," Zach said, casting another magic missile at
 the tree in front of him.
 Zorian didn't think the poor plant would last long if this continued for long.
 "I'm the combat guy.
 It's my thing, and I've been at this for decades longer than you! I can't let
 you outdo me in this area."

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Zorian sighed at the explanation.
 He was getting uncomfortable flashbacks to Taiven's little episode when she
 figured out how good of a combat mage he is.
 Was this a general combat mage thing?

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Well, at least Zach was not crying over it like Taiven had… that would have
 been 

\emph on

really

\emph default

 awkward.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"At least let me show you how to do it properly," Zorian said.
 "You'll never succeed by going at it in your current fashion."

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Zach stopped for a second, considering it, before shaking his head.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Maybe if I still can't figure it out in a few days," he said.
 "I like to figure these sorts of things on my own."

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Oh well, he tried.
 With a helpless shrug, Zorian left Zach to his pointless attempts at
 brute-forcing a problem that required finesse to solve.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Eventually Zach either ran out of mana or got sick of casting magic missile –
 probably just got sick of it, considering his monstrous mana reserves – and
 decided to sit down next to Zorian for a while.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Do you mind if I ask you a little about what you remember about the start of
 the time loop?" Zorian asked after a while.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Feel free," Zach shrugged.
 "But keep in mind that the beginning of the time loop is very fuzzy in my mind
 and I keep having trouble remembering specific things about it."

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Yeah, you mentioned that," Zorian nodded.
 "But I've been thinking about what you've said, both recently and back when
 you still thought I was unaware of the time loop…"

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"That was an asshole thing for you to do," said Zach, interrupting him.
 "I know I've said it before, but it bears repeating."

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"You're never going to shut up about it, are you?" Zorian complained.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Nope," Zach confirmed.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Anyway," Zorian said, deciding there was no point in continuing that topic, "I
 remember you mentioning how you kept trying to convince everyone who would
 listen about the existence of the time loop.
 What was your logic behind that?"

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"I found myself in some crazy time loop and there was an invasion of the city
 at the end of every month," Zach said.
 "Of course I wanted some help."

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"So just to confirm…" Zorian tried.
 "Your earliest memories are of being confused by the situation you found
 yourself in, yes? The time loop was strange and novel to you, not something
 that felt natural?"

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Zach frowned, lost in thought for a while.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Yeah," Zach nodded.
 "Sounds about right.
 It doesn't feel like the time loop was something I was informed of in advance
 or specifically groomed for, if that's what you're asking.
 I guess that's a point in favor of Red Robe being the true Controller, huh?"

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Him being the original Controller still makes no sense to me," Zorian said.
 "Why would he tolerate you all this time if you weren't somehow critical for
 the loop? Do you remember ever experiencing a time loop being cut short for no
 apparent reason?"

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"No," Zach said.
 "I would have remembered something that abnormal.
 I did experience a few unexpected restarts while sleeping, but I'm pretty sure
 those were due to assassinations."

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Hmm.
 I doubt Red Robe never died prematurely, so that means the time loop 

\emph on

only

\emph default

 resets when you die.
 That's a pretty obvious indicator it considers you more important than the two
 of us."

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They continued discussing the issue for another ten minutes of so, with no
 solid conclusions by the end.
 Eventually they shifted to the topic of how to convince people around them
 they really were in a time loop and Zach started sharing some of his more
 amusing failures in his initial quest for allies…

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"You told Benisek that you're a time traveler?" Zorian asked incredulously.
 "I can't believe you thought it was a good idea."

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Shut up," Zach said.
 "Aren't you friends with the guy?"

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Eh, sort of," Zorian admitted.
 "But I'm afraid our friendship didn't quite survive the time loop and its
 influence on me.
 I kind of feel bad, since it's not his fault he can't learn and grow like I
 do, but…"

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"You don't have to explain that to me," Zach said.
 "I used to be casual friends with a lot of our classmates, but I feel
 completely alienated from most of them by now."

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Right," said Zorian.
 Best not to dwell on such a depressing topic.
 "So what exactly happened when you told Benisek about the time loop?"

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"I thought he took it quite well at first," Zach said.
 "Then I came to school the day after and found that he told half the school
 I've gone completely nuts.
 Though funnily, everyone seemed to have a different idea of what kind of crazy
 thing I believed in…"

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Yeah, that sounds like Benisek," Zorian nodded.
 "So when you said you tried to convince everyone, you really meant everyone,
 huh?"

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Well, obviously I couldn't try to convince literally everyone in Cyoria," Zach
 said.
 "But it was a lot of people.
 Students, teachers, city authorities, you name it."

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Zorian tapped his fingers against the ground around him, trying to think of
 some person from their class whose reaction to the time loop would have been
 amusing.
 Oh!

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"How about Veyers?" he asked Zach.
 "Did you ever tell him about the time loop?"

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Who?" Zach asked, looking confused.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Veyers Boranova," Zorian said.
 "You know, the guy who punched you in the face during class in our second
 year? He got expelled from the academy before the time loop began, but he had
 technically been our classmate, so I thought…"

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He stopped when he noticed Zach was giving him a strange look.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"What is it?" he asked.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Zorian… who the hell are you talking about?" Zach asked him slowly.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Zorian stared at Zach for a while, before he began to explain things in more
 detail.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"I'm talking about Veyers Boranova," he said.
 "Member of Noble House Boranova and our classmate during the first two years
 of our education.
 Tall, blond, and with vivid orange eyes that had a slitted iris and made him
 look sort of like a snake.
 You two hated each other… well, just about everyone hated the asshole, and he
 seemed to hate everyone around him, so I guess that doesn't say much but…
 Anyway, the point is that there is no way you could have forgotten the guy!"

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Zach shifted in place uncomfortably.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"I have no idea who you're talking about," he finally admitted.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Wow.
 Now that… that was very, 

\emph on

very

\emph default

 interesting.
