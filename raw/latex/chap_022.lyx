\begin_layout Standard
Zorian woke up in his bed in Cirin, Kirielle wishing him a good morning in that
 charming manner of hers.
 He was annoyed both at himself for not paying more attention to his
 surroundings and at the unknown attacker that did him in.
 It figured that he would survive all those close calls and near-death
 situations, only to get killed by a simple sneak attack.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He passed the train ride sketching magic item blueprints in his notebook.
 Most of them were trivial things, like plates that kept the temperature of a
 meal constant or explosive traps that triggered on their own when certain
 conditions had been met, but he was toying with the idea of designing a
 practice dummy.
 He had found a combination of alteration spells that should allow him to
 construct a dummy out of wooden scraps and soil, but making the animation core
 was no simple task.
 And then, even if he managed that, he would have to design a warding scheme to
 etch into the dummy's surface, lest it disintegrate when he started hurling
 spells at it… possibly in an explosive manner, showering him with wooden
 splinters and shrapnel.
 He should probably also add at least a weak self-repair function, to prevent
 the dummy from falling apart from micro-fractures and such…

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He didn't expect to finish this project in the current restart.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In any case, this time Zorian didn't wait much before contacting the aranea.
 Upon entering his room, he spent an hour crafting a rod of magic missiles for
 basic self-defense and then promptly marched off in the direction of the
 nearest Dungeon entrance.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Unlike his previous attempts to look for aranea, he wasn't simply walking
 around, waiting to stumble upon their scouts – he was trying to sense their
 minds with his brand new mind sense.
 Sadly, he sensed nothing except an occasional rat and-

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He stopped, sensing a mind of unusual strength from one of the rats ahead.
 He mentally ordered his floating light to intensify for a moment and was
 rewarded with a disquieting sight of a rat missing the top of his head.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For a full second, Zorian and the cranium rat stood still and watched one
 another in indecision, trying to decide on a course of action.
 Then – gently, hesitantly – the rat extended a telepathic probe at him, trying
 to worm into his mind.
 For one small moment, Zorian considered trying to take it on telepathically,
 but then discarded the thought as stupid and risky.
 He was completely untrained in telepathic combat, and that one rat was merely
 a conduit for the entire cranium rat collective.
 So instead he drew his brand new spell rod and fired a magic missile at it.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The moment he reached for his spell rod, the rat immediately dropped its
 telepathic probe and tried to run.
 It was too slow.
 The bolt of concussive force slammed into the tiny creature with a loud crack,
 pulverizing its bones and crushing it into paste.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Well, so much for that.
 Zorian extended his mind sense as far as he could, trying to sense the rest of
 the collective, but found nothing.
 Either this one was an isolated scout or the rest had some method of hiding
 from his scans.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By the time he had decided to move on, the pulped body of the cranium rat was
 already being enveloped by a green, translucent mass of crawling gel.
 The oozes that patrolled these walled-off sections of the dungeon were
 artificially engineered to be less dangerous and aggressive than their wild
 counterparts, but Zorian was never a fan of tempting fate and did his best to
 side-step the things as he moved past them.
 Acid burns were hard to heal, even with magic.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When he finally did find the aranea, the meeting was pretty disappointing.
 The aranea he met was one of those that didn't know how to talk to humans, so
 it took him 10 minutes of telepathic pantomime that left him with a raging
 headache, and once the matriarch finally showed up she basically told him to
 get lost for a few days until she came to terms with the contents of the
 memory packet.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Not an unexpected turn of events, but he had been hoping that the matriarch had
 refined her memory packet into something that could convince her past-self a
 bit faster than last time.
 The matriarch was a bit pushy and conceited, but it was nice to talk to
 someone about the time loop.
 Also, the truth was that there was little he could do to unravel the mystery
 of the time loop without aranea help other than steadily gathering magical
 skills and keeping his eyes open.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As he walked back to his room to sleep off his newly-acquired headache, he
 tried to think of a way to advance faster in his magical studies.
 He needed a teacher.
 One willing to teach him spells most instructors would consider too dangerous
 for the likes of a freshly certified student.
 Who did he know that would… oh.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That just might work.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The next day, when Taiven came to recruit him into her little sewer expedition
 she found him practicing combat spells on one of the Academy training grounds
 instead of sleeping in his room.
 He could have easily warded himself against her divination spells at this
 point, but having her track him down was part of the plan: he was hoping to
 recruit her as a sparring partner, and possibly teacher.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He had always thought he had gotten over Taiven's (oblivious) rejection of him,
 but apparently there was still some lingering resentment remaining because he
 noticed something very important in the previous restart.
 Something he should have noticed way sooner, had he not been unconsciously
 ignoring her and pushing her away.
 Taiven was not at all opposed to helping him out, especially if the help was
 somehow related to combat.
 Why was he insisting on learning combat magic alone, without an instructor,
 when he was friends with someone who specialized in that very field of magic?

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So here he was, carefully casting magic missiles at the target in front of him,
 trying to make them as mana efficient as possible.
 He was hoping that Taiven would offer to help on her own when she saw him
 practicing, and he wasn't disappointed.
 She did, however, attach a condition to her offer.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"So, in conclusion, I get a month of instruction from you, free of charge, in
 exchange for joining you on this sewer run of yours?" Zorian asked.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Yup!" Taiven said happily, looking very satisfied with herself.
 Zorian could guess why – she just found a way to pressure him into
 accompanying her, and all it took was promising to do something she was
 inclined to do anyway.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"I suppose that's okay," said Zorian, mentally considering how he should
 approach this.
 He could, of course, simply trail after them and let them fumble around for a
 while – it's what Taiven expected him to do, and he was pretty sure the aranea
 wouldn't 'attack' while he was present.
 However, after some thought, he decided to go for a different path.
 "I have a request though.
 I am on speaking terms with a colony of sentient spiders living in the sewers,
 and I have a sneaking suspicion they're the ones that supposedly took the
 watch.
 I'd like to try actually talking to them before you go in and start burning
 things."

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Taiven gave him a curious look.
 "You are friends with a bunch of giant, sewer-dwelling spiders?"

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Pretty much," Zorian agreed with her.
 He would describe the aranea as acquaintances and allies of convenience
 instead of friends, but she didn't have to know that.
 "I trust you and your friends can keep that a secret? I'm sure you can see why
 spreading that around might cause problems for me and the spiders both."

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Don't worry, I'm not a tattletale," Taiven said dismissively.
 "And I've yet to see Grunt and Mumble engage in any kind of gossip, so your
 secret is safe with us, oh great monster charmer.
 You think they'll just hand us the watch if we ask?"

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"If the client's story is not made up, then yes.
 I don't see what use they would have for a pocket watch.
 But anyway, I have a request for you before you run off to do your thing."

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Oh? And what's that?"

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Teach me a fire spell more destructive than flamethrower," Zorian said.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"How big are your mana reserves?" Taiven immediately asked, not at all
 disturbed by the request.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Magnitude 12," Zorian said.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Hmm, a little lower than I thought, but decent enough I guess," Taiven said.
 Zorian decided to keep quiet about the underwhelming nature of his natural
 reserves.
 "What kind of spells are you looking for, anyway?"

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Preferably something that can one-shot a troll," Zorian said.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Taiven looked at him like he was crazy.
 "What? Roach, you're far too green to go around picking fights with trolls.
 What the hell are you on?"

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Just humor me, Taiven," Zorian sighed.
 "Besides, this is pure self-defense – I won't be picking fights with
 anything."

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Hmph," Taiven shrugged.
 "Says a guy who goes around meeting giant spiders in the sewers in his free
 time.
 But alright, I guess if you're going to do stuff like that you'll need some
 stronger spells under your belt.
 I expect an explanation about that soon, though."

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"After the summer festival," agreed Zorian smoothly.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"I'll hold you to that," Taiven said, poking him painfully in the chest.
 "Now, there are two spells that kind of fit your criteria, although they will
 only kill a troll if you can hit the troll in the face with them – fire bolt
 and incinerating ray.
 The bolt can home in on the target and is cheaper in terms of mana use.
 The ray is far more damaging, but also far more of a mana hog and you need to
 worry about your aim."

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Teach me both," said Zorian.
 The bolt seemed like something that would be more generally useful for someone
 like him, but he needed the raw power as well.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"You sure you have the shaping skills for this, Roach?" Taiven asked.
 "'Cause this kind of spell isn't going to fizzle out if you fail – it will
 blow up in your face."

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Zorian snorted derisively.
 "Trust me, shaping skills are not something I'm lacking in," he said.
 He raised his arm into the air, palm pointed towards the earth, and willed
 some of the dust and dirt to rise towards it.
 The dry, loose material that covered the training ground slowly rose towards
 his hand in a diffuse pillar, coalescing into a rough sphere once they reached
 his palm.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once he was satisfied with the size of the sphere, he pointed his palm towards
 one of the targets and willed the mass of dirt rapidly forward, catapulting it
 towards the target.
 Sadly, the impromptu construct was too structurally unsound and disintegrated
 into dust halfway towards the target, so some of the effect was ruined.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It didn't make the feat any less impressive to Taiven, though.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Damn, that was impressive as hell," Taiven said.
 "How can you do that? I don't think 

\emph on

I

\emph default

 could do that...
 Lift a rock off the ground, sure, but diffuse material like soil? That's a
 pretty advanced exercise.
 Hmm, if your shaping skills are that good, I guess there are a few more spells
 I could teach you…"

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Zorian smiled.
 This had definitely been a good idea.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
- break -
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
During the next several days, while he waited for Taiven to gather her team for
 the journey into the city's sewers, Zorian got a crash course in combat magic
 from his friend.
 Taiven took a surprisingly broad approach to the topic, opting to teach him as
 many different spells as she could manage instead of having him practice a few
 until he had a firm hold over them.
 She claimed that he already had a core of spells he was properly proficient
 in, and that he needed variety and breadth of possible options more than he
 needed a new ace in the hole, but she later admitted she was testing him,
 trying to discover the limits of his shaping skills.
 Something she didn't end up finding – Zorian's shaping skills were better than
 hers; every spell she could cast, he could as well.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Not all of the spells she taught him were of the typical offensive sort he
 expected from her.
 Some of them, like the 'spider climb' spell that allowed him to cling to sheer
 walls and other stable surfaces, 'featherfall' that allowed him to survive
 high falls, or the various comfort spells that blunted temperature extremes
 and other environmental conditions, could be more properly classified as
 survival spells.
 Nonetheless, Taiven insisted that sometimes the environment itself was just as
 big of a danger to a mage as his living opponents, and that he needed to know
 these spells if he was going to waltz around the dungeon and similar places.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
She was also fairly horrified by his lack of defensive spells.
 Not just a lack of any defensive barriers more substantive than the basic
 shield, though she wasn't happy about that either – no, she was talking about
 wards.
 Wards were fairly useless once the fight started, since they were slow to
 cast, and few opponents would give a mage the time needed to cast them during
 a battle, but Taiven claimed they were absolutely essential for a mage who
 expected to get into a fight.
 So long as you weren't ambushed or otherwise surprised, and actually knew you
 were going to be in a fight soon, you could at least cast some basic wards to
 improve your spell resistance and counter some of more common spells.
 And if you actually knew something about your opponent's spell repertoire and
 specialties? Then you could really ruin their day with a few choice wards.
 This was the reason why humanity had been steadily encroaching on monster-held
 territory with every passing year – most magical creatures only had a handful
 of inborn magical tricks and abilities on their side and once you knew what
 they were you could devise a perfect counter for them in advance.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Unfortunately, you could only stack so many wards on top of each other before
 they started to interfere with each other and the whole edifice collapsed, and
 some of them inherently interfered with each other's operation, so knowing how
 to combine them effectively was a bit of a specialist skill.
 Taiven was not very proficient with wards herself, being more offensively
 focused, so he would need to find somebody else for anything except the
 basics.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, most of the spells she taught him were various offensive and defensive
 energy projections, largely ones revolving around fire and force, but also
 some spells based on cold and electricity.
 Among other things, Zorian could now cast the ever-famous fireball spell…
 exactly twice before he ran out of mana.
 So not very useful, honestly, but Taiven claimed that any mage worth their
 name should be able to cast a fireball, and that the utility of such spells
 would naturally increase along with his mana reserves.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Actually, I'm curious… is there some way to speed up the growth of mana
 reserves?" asked Zorian.
 "I know that artificially increasing them has bad side-effects, but is there
 some kind of training method that would speed up natural growth?"

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Taiven looked at him, looking apprehensive.
 "Technically, yes," admitted Taiven reluctantly.
 "It's as simple as using mana-intensive spells to constantly exhaust your
 reserves.
 It would kick the growth of your reserves into overdrive.
 However, that kind of unnatural growth would completely wreck your current
 shaping skills – your normal growth of reserves is so slow because your soul
 is making sure your control over mana doesn't slip.
 Wrecking your shaping skills just to speed up the growth of your reserves is
 really short-sighted, Roach.
 Please don't do it.
 I never would, and you know I'm not exactly the most responsible girl.
 Surely you can wait for a few years for them to grow on their own?"

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Well he certainly wasn't pressed for time at the moment, Zorian had to admit.
 "I suppose that makes sense," he said.
 "I guess the reason why mana reserves plateau after a while is that there is
 only so much power a soul can safely handle.
 Increasing the cap artificially after that point messes up the mage's shaping
 skills with no hope of ever regaining them.
 No wonder everyone recommends against doing it – no matter how benign the
 enhancement process, the result is still more power and less control over it."

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"There is always a trade-off between control and power," said Taiven.
 "It's just not apparent most of the time, since very few people try to develop
 their shaping skills to their limits.
 Many mages think that having more mana is always better, since you can always
 work harder on your shaping skills, but increasing your mana reserves without
 bad side effects is essentially impossible.
 It's not true, though.
 No matter how much time they spend honing their shaping skills, people with
 huge mana reserves are outright incapable of performing some particularly
 finesse-focused spells – things like advanced mind magic, detailed illusions
 and complex alteration constructs."

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Wait, you're saying that I'll lose the ability to cast finesse-based spells as
 my mana reserves increase?" asked Zorian in alarm.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"No, no, I'm talking about your 

\emph on

natural

\emph default

 mana reserves – your inborn capacity before you start to increase it through
 regular spellcasting.
 About magnitude.
 Most spells, even highly sophisticated ones, are designed for average mages –
 magnitude 8 to 12, in other words.
 You're 12, so still comfortably within the intended range.
 Hell, I've heard of a one particular 15 magnitude mage that became a damn good
 illusionist, so even if you tip over a little it will hardly matter."

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Considering Zorian's real magnitude was 8, he apparently had nothing to worry
 about.
 Still, it did make him wonder about Zach, who seemed to have magnitude in the
 low 60s.
 How did that kind of monstrous power factor in Taiven's scheme?

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"How about people with really high magnitude?" asked Zorian.
 "How high can you go before finesse-based spells become impossible?"

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"I've never seen hard numbers, but I'd guess around magnitude 20 or so," Taiven
 shrugged.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"How about the really high numbers?" Zorian asked.
 "Something like magnitude 60?"

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Taiven blinked, seemingly baffled by the question.
 "Well, that would be downright inhuman!" she said finally.
 "Is that even possible? Anyway, I'm not sure whether that would even be a good
 thing, even for a battlemage like me.
 Anyone with such mana reserves would have to spend years longer than their
 peers just to gain a basic level of proficiency expected of a certified mage.
 Maybe as much as a decade even, I don't know."

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Zorian thought about what a relative failure Zach was before the time loop and
 frowned.
 He had thought that Zach had simply been a lazy slacker, but maybe there was
 more to it than that? Then again, he had a feeling Zach was a special case.
 Those inhuman mana reserves were just that – completely outside the human
 range.
 He found absolutely no records of people like that in any of the books, and
 most of the experts he asked flat out told him such people didn't exist
 outside of myths.
 Also, while Zach had been a crappy mage, he did succeed in getting certified
 so his huge mana reserves clearly weren't as crippling as they should have
 been.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Maybe it was a Noveda House bloodline? One that gave their family huge reserves
 without the crippling loss of control, perhaps.
 Of course, the Noveda publically claimed they had no bloodline, but it
 wouldn't be the first time a House had lied.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"I hesitate to even bring this up," Taiven said, breaking him out of his
 thoughts, "but if you're really desperate for a short term mana boost, you can
 always absorb ambient mana faster than you can assimilate it.
 I'm sure you're aware of the drawbacks, though…"

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Zorian nodded.
 There were two main forms of mana available to the mage: his personal mana and
 the ambient one that emanated from the underworld.
 Personal mana was something that all things with a soul possessed in varying
 amounts, and it was attuned to the person producing it – it bent easily to its
 creator's will, and was innately more malleable and controllable than anything
 else they might use to power their magic, since it never resisted the caster's
 efforts to shape it.
 Ambient mana, on the other hand, was both harder to control and toxic to
 living beings.
 Not enough to kill a mage just for using it once, but any substantial,
 prolonged use resulted in sickness and insanity.
 The mages of old believed that ambient mana was tainted by the World Dragon's
 hate for humanity and shunned its use, but modern mages had discovered a few
 tricks to making use of it.
 One was by using it to power items, which had no minds to corrupt or bodies to
 sicken.
 The other was to assimilate the ambient mana into their personal reserves,
 negating its toxic properties.
 While the process of assimilation was too slow to power actual spells, being
 able to regenerate personal reserves faster was useful enough that the skill
 spread far and wide.
 These days, every student of magic was taught how to do it along with the
 other basics of spellcasting.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"I'll get sick," Zorian said.
 "And possibly mad, if I keep using it constantly."

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Right," Taiven said.
 "Using raw mana on a regular basis is pretty stupid, but if you're in a real
 bind… well, it's better to spend a few days bedridden with a fever than end up
 dead."

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"You've used it before," guessed Zorian.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Taiven gave him a surprised look, like it was unexpected he figured it out.
 "Uh, maybe once? Or twice?" She shifted her stance, looking uncomfortable.
 "But keep quiet about that, will you? Most combat mages have done it a couple
 of times in their life, but Guild inspectors don't accept 'everybody's doing
 it' as an excuse."

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Zorian made a gesture over his mouth, indicating that his lips are sealed.
 It's not like she didn't know plenty of things to get him in trouble with,
 anyway.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Let's just get back to the lesson, oh great teacher," Zorian said.
 "Since you're so intent on teaching me mana-intensive fire spells, how about
 that fire vortex I heard you can cast…"

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
- break -
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the time came, Taiven and her two friends let Zorian take point as he led
 them towards aranea territory.
 They had already tried and failed to divine the location of the watch, which
 wasn't terribly unusual if it really was taken by the aranea – the aranea had
 been engaged in a shadow war with the invaders for a while now, even before
 the time loop started, and their anti-divination wards were top-notch.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
[We meet again, Zorian Kazinski,] the matriarch spoke telepathically to him.
 She was surrounded by 6 honor guards, though only 2 were actually visible
 while the other four hung from the ceiling while under some kind of
 invisibility spell.
 Zorian only knew they were there because he could sense their minds.
 [And once again you bring additional guests with you.
 Three of them this time.
 If this pattern continues, we'll have to find a more spacious area to house
 them all after a few more restarts.]

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
[Funny,] Zorian sent back.
 [But actually, this is the group I was a part of when I first met the aranea.
 We were looking for a watch supposedly in your possession then, same as we are
 now.
 Sounds familiar?]

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"What's going on?" asked Taiven.
 She and her two friends were hanging in the back, looking apprehensively at
 the three spiders in front of them.
 "Why are you just staring at them?"

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before Zorian could say anything, the matriarch started waving her front four
 legs in the air for a while and then spoke.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"What's this about a watch I hear?" she asked, turning her two biggest,
 forward-facing eyes at Taiven.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It took a few minutes of explaining and clarifications, but in the end the
 matriarch finally seemed to remember the event in question.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Oh, now I remember," she said.
 "Though the man in question certainly wasn't any kind of innocent passerby,
 and the 'watch' is no simple time-keeping device – he had assaulted our web
 with a couple of other thugs and ended up dropping his bauble when we chased
 them off."

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
[He's one of the invaders,] the matriarch told him telepathically, so only he
 could hear.
 [Or at least he works for them.
 You say you saw him? Excellent, we finally have an entry point into the
 organization.
 A face, a name and face-to-face contact should be enough to divine where he
 lives… you know his name, don't you? Excellent.
 Hopefully he gave away his real one.
 Did you shake hands with him when you accepted the job? No? Try to shake hands
 with him when you give him the device.
 Maybe put a tracking spell on it if you know how…]

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Somehow, the matriarch was able to participate in two separate conversations at
 once, speaking out loud to Taiven and her two friends as she spoke
 telepathically to Zorian.
 Zorian himself was not similarly blessed, and mostly tuned out her explanation
 to Taiven in order to absorb what she was telling him mentally.
 Finally, she seemed to realize this and cut her telepathic communication with
 him short, allowing him to pay attention to what she had been saying to
 Taiven.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"…so I'm not sure what the device is for, but it's clearly a magical item of
 some sort," the matriarch said out loud.
 "It's useless for us aranea, but we are well familiar with the concept of
 trade.
 We were hoping to trade it to some of our human contacts for something we can
 actually use, but since it's our dear friend Zorian that's asking for it, I
 guess we'll give it to you as a favor.
 I'm sure Zorian will make it up to us… eventually."

"Uhh…" fumbled Taiven, looking at him uncertainly.
 "Is… that okay, Roach? Are you…?"

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Yeah, I'm fine with that," Zorian shrugged.
 Although as far as he was concerned he didn't really owe any favors to the
 matriarch for this.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
[I only said that for appearances sake,] the matriarch told him telepathically.
 [It would be weird if we just gave it up for no reason.
 Besides, as far as 

\emph on

I'm

\emph default

 concerned, you will repay my generosity by helping me track down your employer
 so we can wring him for information.]

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Fang of Victory will go and retrieve the bauble," the matriarch said out loud,
 causing one of the two visible honor guards to suddenly skitter off into the
 darkness.
 "I'd ask you to warn your employer against further aggression against us, but
 it's probably best if you keep quiet about talking to us."

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Why did he attack you anyway?" asked Taiven.
 "You seem nice enough to me."

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Most places will kill sentient monsters as a matter of course, if they find
 them within their borders," Grunt said.
 He and Mumble were both pretty quiet thus far, so it was a bit startling to
 hear him speak up all of the sudden.
 Taiven gave him a dirty look for his remark.
 "What? I'm just saying he didn't need a reason.
 Their presence would be offense enough for some people."

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"It's a little more complex than that," the matriarch said.
 "Humans clash with other sentient races, that is true, but that's because most
 of them are highly territorial, murderous, view humans as food or all three.
 On occasions where that wasn't the case, humans have shown themselves willing
 to make exceptions and take a more… nuanced approach.
 There are several dragons that deal with humans in a peaceful manner, the
 lizardmen of Blantyrre have long been a trading partner for human nations, and
 many of the splinter states bordering the wilderness have made secret or not
 so secret pacts with various spirits and monster clans living within their
 nominal borders."

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"You've thought about this a lot," Zorian remarked.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Though not well known, we have been peacefully interacting with humanity for
 quite a long time now", the matriarch said.
 "The aranea have been living in the deeper levels of the dungeon for as long
 as this city has existed.
 When the foundations were being laid, several campaigns were launched into the
 local sections of the dungeon to clear out the threats lurking inside it.
 However, this power vacuum also allowed weaker races like aranea to move into
 the place.
 The dungeon around the Hole is prime real estate for magical creatures of all
 breeds, as you probably know, and the competition was fierce.
 Fortunately, while we aranea lacked the brute strength or destructive magical
 abilities of some of our competitors, we were far more willing to cooperate
 with humans to our mutual benefit.
 We contacted some of the humans that were willing to cooperate with us and
 gave them information about our mutual enemies – their strengths and
 weaknesses, where they lived, the timing of their attacks and movements…
 everything they needed to wipe them out, or at least weaken them to the point
 where we could finish the job.
 Information gathering has always been our specialty."

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Zorian found himself fascinated by the story, and more than a little surprised
 that the matriarch was willing to say all this in front of Taiven and her
 friends.
 Then again, Zorian never told them that aranea were mind readers, so their
 minds were completely unshielded - the matriarch probably had a pretty good
 picture of how likely they were to cause trouble for her.
 And they weren't going to remember anything about this when this loop ended,
 either.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Although giving information to humans helped us as well as them, we rarely did
 it for free – in return for our secrets, we demanded some of your own.
 Our human allies used the information we provided to make a name for
 themselves and further their careers, and in return they taught us some of
 your magic and helped us adapt it for our own use.
 Armed with our very own system of structured magic, the aranea grew in
 strength and versatility, solidifying their hold over this region and making
 the web that lived beneath Cyoria the most prestigious of aranean webs.
 The resulting prosperity caused their numbers to swell, and they sent a
 never-ending stream of colonists and breakaway webs to the surrounding region,
 where they proceeded to evict or subjugate every lesser aranean web they
 encountered.
 But although these aranea left Cyoria in search of their own destiny, no place
 had the prestige or opportunities that Cyoria offered, and thus viewed their
 mother web with envy and resentment.
 Soon, a number of these breakaways banded together and, armed with the
 experience of fighting the lesser webs for territory, drove the original web
 out of their homeland.
 It would not be the last time Cyoria changed hands.
 The conquerors were soon evicted by another group of invaders, and this group
 was evicted by another, and then they were evicted by us.
 We are the fifth web to hold this place and while our position is secure at
 the moment, any sort of weakness could cause the neighboring webs to get…
 restless."

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Huh," Zorian said.
 "So if you were, hypothetically speaking, absolutely decimated by someone and
 had your numbers severely reduced?"

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Our neighbors would launch a few probing raids at the very least," the
 matriarch said.
 "But anyway, my point is that humans and aranea are not, nor have they ever
 been enemies.
 Well, barring some… isolated incidents.
 On both sides.
 In fact, it has been my explicit policy to encourage closer links between this
 web and humans living in Cyoria.
 I hope the day will come when aranea will be able to walk the street above in
 open daylight, just like any other citizen."

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"And I suppose you hope the humans will defend you from outside threats, like
 any other citizens," Grunt said.
 "Like, say, from those rival 'webs' that want to take your territory?"

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"I confess that possibility does factor rather heavily into my thinking," the
 matriarch admitted.
 "The city authorities would be a lot less inclined to stand by and watch if we
 had an established, formal relationship with them."

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"So is this your recruiting pitch?" asked Taiven.
 "Are you trying to turn us into your agents?"

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"More contacts is always good," the matriarch said.
 "But no, I'm not trying to recruit you.
 I just sensed you were worried about Zorian's association with us and wanted
 to assuage your fears somewhat.
 Anyway, Fang of Victory is coming back with the bauble so we'll have to cut
 this short here.
 Talk to Zorian if you ever want to chat with us again."

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sure enough, the matriarch honor guard soon returned with the watch.
 Zorian half-expected her to return with the watch gripped in her fangs, but it
 actually came back carrying some kind of leather harness full of pouches
 across its body, one of which held the watch.
 For a moment Zorian wondered how they made that, what with them lacking hands
 and all, but then realized he was being a bit foolish.
 The matriarch had already said they traded with humans for a lot of things –
 this must be one of them.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They quickly said good bye to the aranea and were on their way back to their
 employer, prize in hand.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"I don't know what to think," Taiven said when they put some distance between
 themselves and the aranea.
 "They seemed nice enough, but it's a bit disquieting to find out we have an
 entire colony of these things living beneath the city, pulling their strings
 over gods know how many people."

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Yeah," agreed Mumble quietly.
 Zorian could definitely see why Taiven called him the way she did – he tended
 to talk really softly, making his speech very hard to understand sometimes.
 "Did you know Cyoria is kind of famous for its spider silk? The merchants who
 sell it are really cagy about where they get it in such quantities and have
 declared their source a trade secret.
 Most people think they have managed to create a spider species that can be
 farmed effectively and have a giant farm hidden somewhere, but I think it's
 pretty obvious now where they get it…"

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Zorian mostly kept out of the conversation, alternating between listening to
 their conversation (when they were saying something interesting) and studying
 the device they retrieved from the aranea (when they weren't).
 It was, as the matriarch said, a magical item of some sort – shaped like a
 pocket watch, but not one.
 The hands didn't move, and the screw that should have allowed a person to wind
 it was fused with the casing and seemed to be simply an ornamental bump put
 there to make the illusion superficially convincing.
 He tried to channel mana into it, but that didn't result in anything
 substantial – the device probably required the user to channel mana in a very
 specific manner.
 Many complex magical items did.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The lessons in divining the secrets of magical items that Haslush gave him
 really paid off here.
 Considering its purpose, the device yielded its purpose surprisingly easily –
 to put it bluntly, it was equipment for burglary.
 More specifically, it was a ward scanner, designed to guide and enhance
 divination spells meant to seek out weaknesses in complicated warding schemes
 so they could be broken or bypassed more easily.
 Their employer had probably been trying to identify a hole in aranean
 defenses.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Still, while the purpose of the device was readily apparent to his divination
 spells, its method of operation stubbornly remained a mystery.
 After several unsuccessful attempts to pry the casing open without damaging
 the device, he finally decided to try something… experimental.
 He extruded a mana cloud from his hands, the way he did when picking locks,
 and directed it to trickle into the device's insides through the gaps and
 misaligned seams.
 The resulting information was fuzzy, but told him that the insides were filled
 with brass gears and crystals.
 They were probably not meant to be pried open.
 How then…

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ah, so that was the trick! The hands of the clock weren't just static – they
 were nothing more than an image painted over a glass cover.
 Zorian pressed his finger against the glass cover and pushed it into the
 casing.
 There was a soft click from the inside, and when Zorian released the pressure
 the cover immediately flew open, revealing a complicated interface full of
 dials and sigils.
 

\emph on

Very

\emph default

 complicated interface… he wasn't going to figure this out in the hour or so
 they had until they reached the client.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He was so taking this thing apart to see how it worked in one of the future
 restarts.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
- break -
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finishing the job was done without complications.
 Zorian opted not to put a tracking spell on the device, since he didn't know
 how sensitive the device was and didn't want to ruin it.
 That turned out to be a good choice, as the man immediately cast several
 diagnostic spells on the device once Zorian handed it over, one of which
 Zorian knew to be a spell designed to detect simple tracking spells.
 Once the transaction was done, Zorian insisted they shake hands, claiming it
 was traditional in his village to do so after a successful business deal.
 The man rolled his eyes and mumbled something about yokels, but humored him
 anyway.
 Mission accomplished.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After they all shared a drink in a nearby tavern (Taiven insisted and wouldn't
 hear no from anyone), the group separated.
 Zorian immediately descended to the sewers again and went back to the aranea.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
[A ward reader, you say?] the matriarch asked.
 [It makes sense.
 He and his friends had been hanging out at the edge of our territory for a
 while, trying to stay hidden.
 I'm surprised he hired a bunch of students to get it, though.]

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Yeah, I'm not sure what he was thinking," Zorian said.
 "Seems like a stupid idea to me."

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
[We'll find out in a few days, if all goes well,] the matriarch said.
 [That said, there are other things we must discuss.
 I believe I told you in the previous restart that I happened upon some pretty
 important information.]

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"You did," Zorian agreed.
 "I was wondering what that was about."

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
[It's about the invaders.
 First of all, your guess was right – they are indeed from Ulquaan Ibasa.]

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"I knew it," Zorian scowled.
 "What was it? Are they out for revenge or is this just sheer opportunism?"

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
[A bit of both,] the matriarch said.
 [They resent you for their exile and they think you're weak, now that the
 Splinter Wars and The Weeping wiped out most of your battlemages.
 But that's not the important part.
 The important part concerns a question so basic I'm honestly not sure why
 neither of us thought of it.
 Namely, why exactly did the invasion think they could conquer Cyoria in the
 first place?]

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Zorian opened his mouth to answer 'with the aid of the time loop, duh', but
 then quickly closed it again.
 According to the matriarch, this invasion had been in the works far before the
 start of the time loop.
 Clearly, someone associated with the invasion got brought into the time loop
 eventually and started feeding information to them to make the whole endeavor
 scarily effective, but what about before that? Without knowing exact locations
 of Cyoria's defenses, their initial bombardment would have been a lot less
 damaging than it was.
 Without knowing the Academy's exact ward scheme and how to bypass it, their
 assault at the place would be practically doomed from the start.
 And on top of all that, the matriarch claimed the aranea were successfully
 keeping the invaders out of Cyoria's underworld before the time loop.
 So really, the invasion never really had the chance to take control of the
 place.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Perhaps they didn't," Zorian said.
 "Intend to conquer it, I mean.
 Cyoria is pretty important to Eldemar, but it's not the capital, nor its
 industrial heartland.
 It's the seat of Eldemar's Mage Guild and the home of the world's most
 prestigious mage academy, neither of which is likely to cooperate with the
 invaders.
 Most likely, they just intended to do as much damage as possible.
 Keep Eldemar's magical might busy while they invade with the bulk of their
 forces elsewhere."

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
[You're very close,] the matriarch said.
 [They were indeed trying to cause as much damage to the city as possible, but
 it was to be much more than a simple distraction.
 Apparently, the date of the summer festival is very magically significant.
 It is the day of the year when the barriers between planes of existence are
 the weakest.
 In fact, the weakening starts exactly one month before the date, gradually
 reaching its peak on the day of the festival.
 And this year's summer festival is even more special than usual.
 I'm afraid that us aranea don't know much about astronomy, seeing as we live
 largely underground, but apparently this year's summer festival includes some
 kind of… 'planetary alignment'?]

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Zorian took a deep breath, a shiver running down his spine.
 Of course! How could he have missed it till now? This year's planar alignment,
 signified by several planets aligning with their own, an event that took place
 once every 400 years or so.
 The last time such an event happened, a city of mages took advantage of it to
 teleport their entire city all the way from Miasina to the southern coast of
 Altazia, performing the largest feat of trans-continental teleportation to
 ever be recorded.
 If someone wanted to mess around with space and time on a grand scale, this
 was 

\emph on

the

\emph default

 time to do it.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Yeah, that 

\emph on

would

\emph default

 explain a lot," Zorian finally said.
 "Like why the time loop was initiated now, of all times.
 But wait, how does that help them to do more damage to the city? Did they
 intend to teleport the city into the sea or something?"

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
[No.
 First of all, they intended to summon a large amount of high-level demons to
 help with the invasion.
 This was why they were willing to go through with the attack, despite their
 lack of success against us and their inability to do much to the academy and
 its wards.
 Demons, especially high-level ones, are virtually immune to mental attacks and
 highly resistant to magic.
 The aranea would be massacred in no time at all, and the mages would be too
 busy fighting for their lives to help out the city's mundane defenders.
 Those same defenders would be up against trolls and fire elementals, who are
 immune to firearms, with winter wolves and iron beaks acting as support.
 ]

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"That… that's horrible," Zorian said after digesting that for a second.
 "Why aren't they doing that now?"

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
[They can't, remember? No summoning anything while in the time loop.
 The whole material plane has been cut off from the spiritual ones,] the
 matriarch reminded him.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Oh yeah," Zorian said.
 "I guess that would throw a serious wrench in the works.
 I wonder if they actually went through with the invasion during the initial
 restart when they had no agent inside the time loop.
 They would have surely known their plan was doomed without demonic support."

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
[They probably would,] the matriarch said.
 [The demons were ultimately a distraction, same as the rest of their forces.
 The invasion leadership didn't actually think they were enough to do more than
 cripple Cyoria and they wanted it completely wiped off the map.
 No, the real target lies with the area around the Hole.
 While the defenders were busy fighting for their lives, a group of mages would
 secure the place and enact a grand summoning ritual.]

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Ugh," Zorian grunted.
 "Let me guess: a really big demon."

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
[No.
 They wanted to summon a primordial.]

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Color instantly drained out of Zorian face.
 "What!? But… that would leave the whole city a lifeless crater! What about
 their own forces!?"

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
[Expendable,] the matriarch told him bluntly.
 [Everyone high enough to matter was ready to teleport away at the first hint
 that the summoning was successful, the rest were disposable pawns that were
 never actually expected to survive.
 Besides, you'll notice that the actual invasion force is really light on human
 mages.
 Only a minimum of Ibasan mages was necessary to maintain some control over the
 various demons and monsters.
 And you're actually rather optimistic in your damage predictions.
 The Ibasan leadership hoped that being summoned with the help of the biggest
 mana well on the continent would give the primordial enough power to linger on
 this plane for weeks.
 If so, it would rampage across large swathes of Altazia before finally running
 out of power or until the Altazians managed to organize a group of mages big
 enough to banish it back to its realm.
 Then Ulquaan Ibasa could just swoop in once it's gone and mop up the
 demoralized survivors.]

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Zorian was honestly at a loss for words.
 On one hand, the plan was utterly crazy, and a large part of him wanted to say
 it would never work.
 Where did they even find a ritual to summon a goddamn primordial of all
 things? But still, he'd watched the invaders bulldoze through Cyoria's
 defenses far too many times to discount them like that.
 If they thought the plan could work, it probably could.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Where did they find mages willing to do the summoning?" Zorian asked.
 "They must have known they'd be killed by the primordial's rampage before they
 can escape, being so close to it and all.
 And do you happen to know which primordial it was?"

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
[The summoning would be done by the Esoteric Order of the Celestial Dragon…
 probably known to you by the name 'Cult of the Dragon Below'.
 Apparently they are fully willing to die in order to summon one of the 'Great
 Mother's children'.
 Those of their members not involved with the summoning are helping the
 invasion forces as regular mage support or simple saboteurs, in case of more
 mundane members.
 Actually, now that I think about it, they are probably acting as the invaders'
 inside agents in general; we'll have to infiltrate their group deeper for more
 information.
 Anyway, no, I don't know which primordial.
 Just that it was one of the land-bound ones – the Ibasans didn't want to risk
 it suddenly deciding it wanted to visit their little island and flying over.]

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"I'll bet," Zorian said.
 "Of course, all this means we have a problem on our hands.
 No matter how formidable the invasion is while we're trapped inside the time
 loop, it will be even more fearsome outside of it.
 They will have additional demon support on top of everything they already
 have, and we'll have to spend some of our time thwarting the primordial
 summoning.
 I want to say those cultists are just totally crazy and couldn't summon a
 crippled imp, much less a thrice-damned primordial, but the possibility is
 just so catastrophic we can't afford to risk it."

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
[Yes, this indeed complicates the matter considerably,] the matriarch agreed.
 [My original plan was to keep thwarting the flow of the invasion until the
 third time traveler is forced to reveal themselves, either through sloppiness
 or frustration; lure them into an ambush and mindrape them into catatonia;
 find a perfect counter for an invasion over several restarts; and finally,
 find a way to break the time loop and deal with the invaders for real.
 The part about dealing with the third time traveler still seems workable, but
 finding a perfect counter will clearly be impossible with such a large
 variable missing while we're inside the time loop…]

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Zorian was a tad queasy about how matter-of-factly the matriarch spoke of
 destroying a person's mind, but he had to admit he knew of no other way to
 deal with the third time traveler.
 The only other way involved destroying his soul, and that was arguably even
 more morally reprehensible.
 Plus, he didn't actually know how to destroy someone's soul.
 And hopefully never would.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"Right," Zorian sighed tiredly.
 "What a day.
 Do you have any other bombshells to throw at me?"

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
[Well… not as such, no.
 However, these recent developments mean that I will not have much time to
 teach you this month.
 Fortunately, you are at the level where you don't really need a high-level
 user like me to guide you, so I have found you a suitable replacement.
 Zorian, say hello to Enthusiastic Seeker of Novelty.]

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of the aranea that had accompanied the matriarch, a rather small and
 twitchy individual that seemed to have trouble staying still, suddenly jumped
 down from the ceiling and landed in front of him.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
[Hi! I am Enthusiastic Seeker of Novelty and I will totally be your teacher
 this month! I know you humans have trouble with our names so you can just call
 me Novelty.
 I don't mind!] She circled around him as she spoke to him telepathically,
 looking like some kind of weird puppy inviting him to play with her.
 [Anyway, when the matriarch asked for volunteers to teach you, I was like:
 'this is your chance, Novelty'.
 I was totally game! They won't let me help with defense because I'm supposedly
 too young, but they told me you're a baby at this psychic stuff and I can
 totally take care of babies! And hey, you can teach me stuff too! I was always
 curious about you humans, like how you can walk on your hind legs without
 tipping over all the time or…]

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Zorian tuned out her chatter in favor of giving the matriarch a glare.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
[Does she come with an off button?] he asked telepathically.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The matriarch simply projected a mixture of amusement and satisfaction in
 response.
